## Crosshair for Snipers - Free Fire (Full Safe)

### The tool is **safe** to use, as it doesn't interact directly with the game files, nor does it inject any code into the game. It simply acts as a graphical overlay that helps improve aiming.

This is a simple, customizable crosshair application designed for use with **Free Fire on PC**, specifically to help **snipers** aim with precision. The app is built using `Tkinter` and features a transparent window that overlays the game screen, with a green crosshair at the center. 

## Features

- **Customizable Position**: Click and drag to move the crosshair anywhere on your screen.
- **Lock Position**: Press `F3` to lock the crosshair in place.
- **Always on Top**: The crosshair window remains on top of all other windows, including your game.
- **Transparent Background**: The window's background is transparent (except the crosshair), making it unobtrusive while gaming.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
